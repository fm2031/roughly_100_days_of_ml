# roughly_100_days_of_ml_code
The goal is to work on things every day from RL class with Siraj(Move_37) and Denny Britz's ML repo, while using the list of 200 tutorials for exploratory work.  I'll keep it updated in Log.md with commments/entries... look at this it's becoming a public journal, a sort of soft-core coding voyeurism. Althought that implies someone would have to gain pleasure from looking at it... oh well, onwards, onwards.
