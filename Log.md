## Day 0 : June 30 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have setup everything so I can keep the log of my work daily related to ML/RL/VR. 

**Thoughts** : Main focus will be on working through complementary courses including Denny Britz's ML/RL repo and Siraj Rival's Move_37. Will use list of tutorials in README for exploratory work.

**Ideas** : At some point it would be cool to integrate Zolfran app with github so you could share working code respositories as ideas... maybe used google colab for this?

**Goals/Things going on** : Organzing research for grad schools and beginning application process. Trying to match programmes/people/disciplines is difficult. I'm hoping by continuing my ML learning and creative production, I'll distill my focus down into something I can fit in a paragraph...
